about=With the Transit Reachability Analyser plugin, one can calculate and visualize the reachability of public transport. The itineraries are calculated by OpenTripPlanner. As a result, a point layer with an attribute table is created, providing various information for each station. The results can be displayed as a heatmap. If a polygon layer is generated based on the point layer, it can also be colored in the various color schemes provided by the plugin. Reachability is represented using the indicators travel time, travel time ratio, frequency, walking time, and transfer count.
